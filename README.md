Hi, I'm Gideon Nice to meet you!
Here's a perfect HTML/CSS replica of the figma built with React and Tailwind CSS.

# Getting Started with Lumina Gadgets App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Getting started with initializing the app

This project can only be initialized after running:

### `npm install --force`

This is due to the peer dependency mismatch error generated when you run the usual "npm install"
